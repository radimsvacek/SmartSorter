Make sure that you have installed Qt 4.8 and libraries Poppler and LibExif.

Configure script checks if everything is installed correctly. If it is OK, 
then makefile is created and you can compile application.
Then you can install it with MAKE INSTALL command. This must be done with 
sudo privileges, because app is copied to /usr/local/bin 


Follow these steps:
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure.sh
  make
  sudo make install
  

Now you can run SmartSorter!
